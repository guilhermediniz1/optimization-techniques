## Scenario configuration for irace - EVRP GRASP tuning

## Directory where the programs will be run (relative to tuning/)
execDir = "./"

## Parameter file
parameterFile = "./parameters.txt"

## Training instances directory (relative to tuning/)
trainInstancesDir = "../dataset"

## File with list of training instances
trainInstancesFile = "./instances-list.txt"

## Target runner script
targetRunner = "./target-runner"

## Maximum number of runs (budget for experiments)
## Adjust based on available time - more experiments = better tuning
maxExperiments = 500

## Or use maxTime for time-based budget (in seconds)
## Each run uses 30s, so 500 experiments ~= 4+ hours
# maxTime = 14400

## Parallel execution (set to number of CPU cores)
parallel = 12

## Random seed for reproducibility
seed = 42

## Enable elitist mode (keeps best configurations)
elitist = 1

## First test after this many instances
firstTest = 3

## Test every N instances after firstTest
eachTest = 1

## Confidence level for statistical tests
confidence = 0.95
